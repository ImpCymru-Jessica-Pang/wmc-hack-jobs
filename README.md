# Identify Analytical Jobs in NHS Wales

Challenge 5 from the May 2023 Wales Modelling Collaborative (WMC) [Data Hackathon for Health Care](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/wmc-data-hackathon-11th-18th-may-2023-tickets-483839706587)

## The objectives

There are many interesting questions that could be answered to better understand
the analytical professions in healthcare if we had data on recruitment. 
Unfortunately, the data is not readily available. What makes it more challenging, 
is that analytical elements are important to many other professions, and the that
the analytical jobs are advertised with varying titles and descriptions and a generic
":"Administrative and Clerical" category. 

Example questions of interest:
* What's the rate at which analytical jobs are advertised  
* Comparison of healthboards and their gaps - job advert  
* How can we recruit and analyse on the jobs.  


### 1. Scraping the NHS job adverts for analytical professions

There is no API, or other bulk access to historic job adverts. First part of the challenge 
is to collect the publically available job adverts for analysis now and in the future. 

### 2. Classification of the job descriptions

Because there is no consistency of how the jobs are advertised
there is a need to find a way to reliably identify jobs where data analysis is not only 
part of requirements, but is core to the profession of data analyst.
